# Fertify Logo Implementation Guide

## Files to Create
1. **icon.png** (1024x1024px) - Main app icon for App Store/Google Play
2. **adaptive-icon.png** (1024x1024px) - Foreground image for Android adaptive icons
3. **splash-icon.png** (1200x1200px) - Centered logo for splash screen
4. **favicon.png** (192x192px) - Web favicon
5. **fertify-full-logo.png** (1500x500px) - Horizontal logo with text for website/marketing

## Design Instructions

### App Icon (icon.png)
- Create a square icon with a subtle rounded rectangle shape
- Background: Gradient from #2E7D32 (forest green) to #1E8C3B (slightly brighter green)
- Center element: Stylized leaf with embedded circuit-like patterns in lighter green (#81C784) and tech blue (#1976D2)
- Keep the design clean and recognizable at small sizes
- Ensure contrast between foreground and background elements
- No text should be included in the app icon

### Android Adaptive Icon (adaptive-icon.png)
- Design a version of the icon that works within the Android adaptive icon system
- Foreground image should be the leaf with circuits on transparent background
- Allow for safe area as Android will apply masking and effects

### Splash Screen (splash-icon.png)
- Create a larger version of the main icon to be displayed during app loading
- Add "AI-Powered Agriculture" as a tagline below in a light, modern font
- Background should be white (#FFFFFF) for clean appearance

### Web Favicon (favicon.png)
- Simplified version of the app icon optimized for very small display
- Focus on the most recognizable elements that work at 16x16, 32x32, and 192x192 pixels

### Full Logo (fertify-full-logo.png)
- Horizontal layout with icon on left
- "Fertify" text in Montserrat Bold or similar modern sans-serif font
- Optional tagline "AI-Powered Agriculture" in lighter weight below main text
- Color scheme should match the app icon

## Technical Guidelines
- All files should be provided in PNG format with transparency
- Include vector versions (SVG/AI) for print and scalable usage
- Optimize all PNG files for web and mobile use
- Follow platform-specific guidelines for Android and iOS
- Provide both light and dark mode versions for versatility

## Usage Rules
- Maintain spacing around logo (minimum clear space equal to height of "F" in Fertify)
- Do not stretch, distort, or recolor the logo outside approved color variations
- Do not add effects like shadows or glows unless specified
- When using on colored backgrounds, ensure sufficient contrast
- For small applications, use the icon-only version
